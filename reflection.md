## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

What did you learn?
    In this assignment I learned my way around VS Code. I previously had VS Code but never really learned how to use it. I was forced to watch a few YT videos on the UI and how to change some of the settings like apperance.
    Another thing I learned was how to use the debugg function. This was very easy and simple to use once I got it figured out. The step over is another tool I learned how to use. 
What confuses you?
    The github confuses me. I think I am doing it right by commiting my changes and syncing, but I dont really know my way around github and also how to use the classroom vs the actual github personal. As far as I know I am doing it right but I need to learn more in class about it.
Where did you struggle?
    I didnt really struggle with much it just took me awhile to find my way around github and VS Code but it was good for me to learn that way.
Where might you need more practice?
    I need more practice using these new apps. I have never used Github before or VS Code, but i need to learn so thats why I am taking this class.
